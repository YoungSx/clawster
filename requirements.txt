# OpenClaw Distributed - Dependencies
# 
# NOTE: This implementation uses a pure Python Redis client (redis_client.py)
# which has NO external dependencies. Python 3.9+ standard library only.
#
# The redis_client.py provides sufficient performance for:
#   - Heartbeat (every 5 seconds)
#   - State sync (occasional, batched)
#   - Leader election (rare events)
#
# Optional: If you need higher Redis throughput, uncomment:
# redis>=5.0.0
#
# No pip install required for basic operation!
